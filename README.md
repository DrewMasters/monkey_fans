# monkey_fans

repo to create a program that implements the random monkeys ranking program

general idea: 
  take a league (such as nfl) and allocate a starting number of monkeys evenly between all teams
  as each game is played team's monkeys have a 75% chance of going to the winner team and 25% change of going to the loser team
  as season progresses the better teams when accumulate more monkeys
